# VTOL-control-by-PID
This work can be seen as a practice of scientific research, so it has less value.

Make a kind of VTOL fixed-wing UAV **model**.
![UAV_model](./images/controller_1.png "UAV_model")

And use **one PID controller** to adjust the max cruising speed and **a cascaded PID controller** to maintain the stability of altitude.


The result is below.

**This is cruising speed curve**

**This is height stability curve**
